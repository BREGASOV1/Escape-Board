**Design**
> I used AI to have some PNGs with Transaparent Background.
> I used Krita to design background Image and The Board Image.
> I used cleanpng.com and treepng.com as basic resources for PNG.

**future plan**
> I will develope it when I learn OOP in C# .
> I will add more features.

**How To Run**
> Make sure you have Visual Studio and C# in it.
> run in your CMD:
cd ( folder path where you want the game file to be)
git clone https://github.com/BREGASOV1/Escape-Board
